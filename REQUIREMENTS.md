# REQUIREMENTS.md: numbers, gates and exceptions

This file decides cooker's commands, numbers, gates and exceptions. Rules live in `AGENTS.md`, `.github/AGENTS.md`, `ui/AGENTS.md` and `crates/AGENTS.md`.
The checker reads files and runs no gates. Write commands in backticks and escape cell-internal pipes as `\|`.

## Rule files

List every project `AGENTS.md`. Checked files supply `###` groups and tagged rules; unchecked files need a reason. The checker skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `third_party` and hidden directories other than `.github`.

| File | Checked | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AGENTS.md | yes | Repository-wide rules; CLAUDE.md imports this file |
| .github/AGENTS.md | yes | CI rules; .github/CLAUDE.md imports this file |
| crates/AGENTS.md | yes | Backend rules; crates/CLAUDE.md imports this file |
| ui/AGENTS.md | yes | Frontend rules and unchanged Astryx block; ui/CLAUDE.md imports this file |

## Commands

One row per tier. Run commands with the setup and isolation defined in the named workflows. Set PR_TITLE to the proposed PR title before the title check. The requirements check and its self-tests are the `requirements` stage, which the `requirements` job builds on every run and the `check` stage includes, so their failure fails `ci-ok`.
Measure three runs on the build host with date and load before setting a whole-tier limit with margin. Existing workflow timeouts and dashboard limits remain in force.

| Tier | Command | Runs (where, when) | Wall-time limit | Baseline (date, host, load) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-commit | | No tier exists yet | | |
| Merge gate | `docker buildx build --target dashboard .`; `docker buildx build --target check .`; `docker buildx build --target test-report --build-arg SHARD=1 --build-arg SHARDS=2 --output type=local,dest=out1 .` and the same with `SHARD=2`, then `python3 .github/scripts/test-counts.py total out1/counts-1.json out2/counts-2.json`; `docker buildx build --target perf .`; `docker buildx build --target runtime --load -t cooker:ci .`; `docker run --rm cooker:ci --version`; `bench/gate.sh image cooker:ci`; `python3 -I tools/changelog.py check`; `python3 -I .github/scripts/pr-title.py "$PR_TITLE"`; `python3 -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts -p 'test_ci_lanes*.py'`; `docker buildx build --target requirements .` | ci.yml selects lanes on PRs; all lanes on master, manual/release calls and ci:full reruns. The stage contents are in `Dockerfile`. Changes workflow runs fragments/title. The requirements stage (the check and its self-tests) runs on every run, including rule-only and documentation-only changes, and contributes to the `ci-ok` result. | | |
| Release | `git push origin vX.Y.Z`; after approval, `gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z` | The tag runs every CI lane, builds `runtime` natively for amd64 and arm64, checks the tag against `--version` and the image size, pushes the `candidate-X.Y.Z-<commit>` images and creates a draft release recording the candidate's digest. The manual run checks that the tag still points at that commit and that the image reports `X.Y.Z`, tags that digest `X.Y.Z` and `latest` and publishes the draft. Publishing follows root Rule priority. | | |

Before opening a PR, run on the final tree:

- `docker buildx build --target check .`
- `docker buildx build --target test .`
- `docker buildx build --target dashboard .`
- `docker buildx build --target requirements .` when only rule or documentation files changed; the `check` stage includes it otherwise.
- After changes to anything running while the server is idle, also run `docker buildx build --target perf .`.

Before every release, run the dashboard performance harness using `ui/tools/perf/README.md` and compare its measurements with the recorded baseline. This is a measurement step, not a merge gate; exit 0 proves completion, not acceptable performance.

Stage commands and isolation are defined in `Dockerfile`; lanes and coverage in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/AGENTS.md`.

## Numbers

Keep authoritative datasets in their existing source files. Blank baselines await build-host measurement.
UI scale/layout values remain in `ui/DESIGN.md` and code limits in `ui/CONVENTIONS.md`; the empty template rows track their measurement/adoption rather than duplicating those values.

| Item | Limit | Baseline (date, host, load) | Enforced by |

Historical source evidence: `bench/budgets.txt` records dated compiler/runner measurements and tolerances; `ui/REQUIREMENTS.md` retains historical dashboard measurements. Dates, hosts and load are stated only where recorded.

## Deploy-only stream settings

S1 fixes this configuration contract; `ck-stream::Config` implements it for the store, while production bootstrap integration remains part of the S1 execution cutover. All seven values are read and validated at startup. Every change requires a restart. Configured overrides remain supported within the validation and owner ceilings in `docs/INTERNAL-STREAM.md`, §6.4. Schema declarations must mark these values deploy-only; runtime configuration publication must not hot-apply them.

| Setting | Classification | Contract reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream.pool_directory` | Deploy-only; restart required | Private directory and file lifecycle, §6.3 |
| `stream.pool_bytes` | Deploy-only; restart required | Startup tmpfs/cgroup caps and total ceiling, §6.4 |
| `stream.startup_reserve_bytes` | Deploy-only; restart required | Prebacked warm frames within the pool cap, preserved by decay, §6.4–6.5 |
| `stream.max_frames` | Deploy-only; restart required | Derived capped-pool default and combined exchange quota, §6.4 |
| `stream.max_event_bytes` | Deploy-only; restart required | Provisional event limit and startup validation, §6.4 |
| `stream.max_metadata_bytes` | Deploy-only; restart required | Metadata limit (8 MiB default, owner number) and checked capacity validation, §6.4 |
| `stream.cache_ttl` | Deploy-only; restart required | Last-read expiry, §6.4 |

These values need no live-editable admin page or page exception under `crates/AGENTS.md`, Admin panel. Later hot-change support must include its admin page in the same change. Owner-approved codec/pipeline tolerances in `docs/INTERNAL-STREAM.md`, §9.2, allow at most 5% regression per pipeline metric and 0% for memory/storage (2026-11-14 morning, option B); codec CPU and allocation-count rows are reported against absolute per-event budgets instead (2026-11-15). They do not change the existing budgets above or the §9.3 storage gate.

## Enforcement

Names exactly match `###` headings and tags. Gate commands cover existing mechanical checks; Review criterion names the exact `REVIEW.md` section for judgment. Missing required gates remain blank and dated under "Not yet enforced".

## Exceptions

Backend endpoints with no frontend caller:

| Endpoint | Caller | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rows in ui/tools/api-allowlist.json | Per-row CLI, provider callback, other admin client or equivalent dashboard operation | The authoritative method/path/reason list consumed by check-api; migrate its entries with their routes. |

Intentional designs that look like defects:

| What | Why | Owner ruling (date, quote) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compatibility: cooker keeps no backward compatibility in any surface (config, database, CLI, environment, routes, responses, paths, crate names); the management API starts at EXPERIMENTAL `/admin/v0` | It is a full rewrite of an existing project. Valid until an owner sets a compatibility policy, for example at v1. | An owner, 2026-11-13: 「API 要不直接从 v0 开始计，不要向后兼容」; 「完全不需要考虑任何向后兼容性，我们是基于一个现有项目的完整重写」 |
| Dashboard shows provider status/message and OAuth failure detail | Dashboard users operate the upstream connection; backend Security permits operator detail | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; no dated owner quote supplied |
| Sign-in has one raw hidden input carrying the host as username | Password managers need a username; Astryx VisuallyHidden is a span and must not wrap a control | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; no dated owner quote supplied |
| Live usage is opt-in and tab-local | Reading the queue consumes records other consumers could read | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; preserve semantics during migration |
| Write actions are probed before being enabled; unsupported writes are disabled | OPTIONS does not distinguish missing and supported routes | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; retire with the version/contract cutover, not as an unrelated rules fix |
| Config writes reread and compare, refusing stale copies | Prevent two operators or external file edits overwriting one another | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md rationale; not permission for bypass writes under the current state contract |
| Quota fetches are on request, sequential, at most once per account every two minutes | Each fetch is a real provider request | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; ordinary tests remain mock-only |
| Batch actions affect the whole shared credential file and say so in the dialog | Server deletion/toggle operates on files | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design |
| Polling pauses in hidden tabs | Avoid work for an unseen dashboard | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design |
| ProviderIcon.tsx draws brand marks from vendored providerMarks.ts path data | Lucide lacks brand marks; monochrome vendored artwork follows text color; check:ui permits that file's SVG | Existing ui/REQUIREMENTS.md design; attribution/license provenance stays in the existing source and notices |
| Optional Rosé Pine palettes (Main, Moon, Dawn) may fall below WCAG AA | Preserve the optional palettes' published colors; the default Neutral palette must meet AA. Measurements below distinguish AA failures from stricter project-target misses. | An owner, 2026-11-13: 「主題的話是例外的」 |

Contrast inventory copied from `ui/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Browser rows cover rendered sign-in/System pages, open menus and info/error banners at 1440 px in English. Palette rows are computed mapped pairs, not proof they appear in a measured page. Dawn applies to both Rosé Pine palettes. Disabled text is exempt where noted; that does not exempt placeholder text.

Neutral light success (4.53:1) and info (4.85:1) on the page both pass WCAG AA. They miss only the stricter 5:1 project target in `ui/DESIGN.md`; neither is an exception to the AA rule.

Neutral's built palette measures body 18.59 light / 15.13 dark, secondary 8.23 / 5.65, warning text 10.27 / 8.65, and warning badges 7.70 / 6.46. Bar fills are 3.15 / 3.85 and chart volume 4.70 / 3.67 against the 3:1 non-text limit. Source: historical `ui/REQUIREMENTS.md`; date/host/load not recorded.
