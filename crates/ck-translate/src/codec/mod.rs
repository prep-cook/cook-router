//! Boundary codecs for the S1 internal stream. No provider execution or pair dispatch.
//!
//! # Protocol-worker contract
//!
//! Each protocol implements four independent roles: [`RequestIngress`],
//! [`RequestEgress`], [`ResponseIngress`] and [`ResponseEgress`]. Buffered JSON is
//! a body encoding, not a separate semantic pipeline. [`Operation`] includes
//! generation, count and compact; a protocol without an operation rejects it.
//! Count results never become generation usage, and compact is never a summary
//! substitute. Keep the old pair registry untouched until integration cutover.
//!
//! Ingress consumes leased mapped spans through [`source::Source`]. Scanners keep
//! coordinates and bounded metadata, not body-sized strings or JSON values.
//! Unknown fields retain their source positions, nesting, scalar types and order;
//! unknown SSE records retain all fields. A wire `x_ck` is provenance, never a
//! trusted envelope or media registration. Protocol modules emit the grammar in
//! `docs/INTERNAL-STREAM.md`; only a trusted internal reader interprets envelopes.
//! Use [`event::Emitter`] for canonical publication: it owns trusted identity,
//! sequence, request-end fencing and terminal state. Protocol codecs own payload
//! schema and choice/item/tool/media lifecycle validation.
//!
//! Request ingress validates complete syntax and protocol schema before asking
//! the destination [`Capability`] validator to inspect **every** mapped semantic:
//! model/operation, roles/content, tool declarations/choice/history linkage,
//! replay, cache directives, sampling/limits, output schema/modalities, session
//! controls and provider parameters. Unknown provenance alone is not a rejection.
//! [`ValidatedRequest`] is the execution fence: upstream request encoding accepts
//! no unfinished request. A failed fence emits no `request.end` or success.
//!
//! Response ingress splits choices and parts in source order, keeps independent
//! lifecycle state, forwards tool argument fragments immediately and publishes
//! only complete SSE/JSON records. Usage snapshots replace supplied fields;
//! missing/null counts are not zero. Only canonical `x_ck.usage` is accounting
//! authority. Final snapshots reconcile rather than replay content. EOF is not
//! success: protocol completion plus closed choices/tools/media is required.
//!
//! Response egress alone projects destination losses and decides deliverability.
//! Suppressed metadata produces no bytes. Unknown data reaches this boundary;
//! emit it at its native location/carrier or report a content-free diagnostic.
//! Buffered output and final snapshots read retained positions, never accumulate
//! payloads on the heap. Encoded output uses [`encode::publish`] on mapped storage.
//! No protocol worker edits shared modules/manifests without the framework owner.
//!
//! # Storage integration
//!
//! Sources and scanners bind to one writer, including empty inputs. Raw input
//! and external encoded output use unpublished scratch leases; canonical events
//! alone enter the publication log. All metadata capacity reserves permits from
//! that writer's quota before allocation. Scratch drops independently; never
//! release a response prefix to reclaim parser input.
